# Resolving_regression-problems_using_weight_updates_with_SGD
Python code for 'resolving regression problems using weight updates via SGD' without using Python libraries and machine learning frameworks

Data: iris_data

Goal: classification

Code: All code required by the classification model architecture, such as partial differential equations for gradient updates in the Stochastic gradient gradient gradient (SGD), is written BY own without using the neural network Python tool function.
